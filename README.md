# Product Analysis: Project Overview
Evaluated historical data of movie rental company to provide insights prior to the launch of a new online streaming service. Findings include top-earning films, customer behvaior, and geographic sales data. Used SQL to organize, clean, filter, and join data to answer complex business questions. Created visuals with SQL results in Tableau.

## Tools & Skills
PostgreSQL
* Filter, summarize, and clean data
* Join tables within dataset using primary and foreign keys
* Utilize subqueries and common table expressions for more complex queries

Tableau
* Data Manipulation
* Visualizations

## Purpose & Context
I was tasked to perform an exploratory analysis on multiple data sets using SQL, Tableau, and Excel to generate insights to answer key stakeholder questions. I was responsible for deciding on the project scope and final presentation format. This project was a part of 
CareerFoundryâ€™s Data Immersion curriculum and was evaluated with feedback by a tutor and mentor.

## Data Cleaning, Integration, and Transformation
* Checked for duplicates and null values within each data table.
* Checked for value format consistency within each column.
* Performed inner joins to connect tables.
* Wrote outer statement to generate new variables (i.e. "average_amount_paid" and "top_customer_count").

## Visualizations
Below are a few of the key visuals included in this analysis:

## Recommendations and Findings
* Focus brand in Asian markets where largest customer base and revenue streams are located.
* Films rated PG-13 are the most popular and generate the largest total revenue.
* Top customers were discovered based on rental frequency and total spending. Length of membership should also be considered when measuring for customer loyalty.
* Include additional data measures (customer age, language, movie genres, etc.) to understand each customer segment.
* Continually update film inventory based on customer demographics and behavior.
